            <h1>Why is it Important for Games to Have Long Lives?</h1>
            <img src="media/Games%20relationships.jpg" alt="Relationship Between Players, Games, and Industry">
            <p>In nearly all video game settings, there is a direct relatonship between the players, developers and the game. From both the consumer and the developer standpoint, having a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/19/video-games-nexon-ceo-says-longevity-is-critical-for-video-games.html">long-lived game is important</a>. For the developers, continued life of a game provides extra profits and aeventually creates a passionate fanbase if development is continued. Modern games are <a href="https://www.nyfa.edu/student-resources/developers-increasing-lifespan-games/">much more expensive</a> to make than they used to be in the early days of the gaming industry.  For the players, they get to continue experiencing their favorite games and can enjoy updates to the game to remove bugs, glitches and improve overall gameplay with <abbr title="Downloadble Content">DLC</abbr>, new game modes, and more. Having a developed community that is actively involved in the game and reaching out to game developers will ensure that a game lives longer. Of course, development on one game cannot continue forever since technology is always advancing, but keeping games around as long as possible creates a good reputation for the game company and the game itself.
