            <h1>What is Team Fortress 2?</h1>
                <p>Team Fortress 2, also known as TF2 for short, is a class-based <abbr title="First-Person Shooter">FPS</abbr> released by Valve in 2007. The game involves 9 classes that a player can choose from that each have different strengths, weaknesses, and abilities.

                    <li>Taking the enemy's intelligence briefcase in a game of <b>Capture the Flag</b></li>
                    <li>Capturing or defending <b>Control Points</b></li>

            <h1>Team Fortress 2 and Longevity</h1>
            <p>When it comes to cases of games that have had a long lifespan, Team Fortress 2 is certainly a great example of this. With semi-frequent major updates continually being released 12 years after the game's launch, TF2 manages to maintain its developer's support. This continued support by Valve is no doubt due to the substantial player base that is fiercely loyal to the game, with over <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/440">50,000</a> players playing the game at any given time. What has kept players so interested in the game after all this time? Well countless factors are in play here. Like I mentioned above, the number of gamemodes and ways to play the game as I listed above provides a way for any player to enjoy the game, regardless of skill or playstyle. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/how-team-fortress-2-changed-fpses-forever/">PC Gamer</a> argues that Team Fortress is revolutionary in its character and dialogue decisions, where the universe is made of fun and unique charcters that all seem to have complex relationships and storeis told through character voice lines. For instance, the player can discover that the Spy is romantically involved with the Scout's mother and the Medic is an insane doctor who had lost his medical license, all through hearing the characters interact with each other.

            <p>In addition to good humor and fun characters, the gameplay itself is rewarding and fun for the player. Team Fortress 2 Youtuber LazyPurple describes the design concepts that make Team Fortress 2 so enjoyable in his video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuqImZKygvw&vl=pt">"Team Fortress 2 is a Timeless Masterpiece"</a>. To put it simply, the weapons are risky, but rewarding to use, and the movement is highly emphasized by the "hit-or-miss" nature of the weapons. When these aspects are combined, newer players can pick up the game and slowly learn from their experiences in a way that reduces frustration and maximizes enjoyment.
